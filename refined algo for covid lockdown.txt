Refined algorithm for COVID Lockdown Strategy : (soln by mohd. )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



def refinedLockdown(no.ofcases) : 

 for the whole (population.count) in a particular geographical location : 
   While (no.ofcases < 5) : 

	1. TRACK and TRACE (Identify the number of cases(no.ofcases)).
	2. LOCKDOWN for the infected, vulnerable and exposed.
	3. NO LOCKDOWN for Healthy, Vaccinated or the recovered with antibodies.
	
return (all okay) 



Feasibility analysis : 

Pros : 
-----------------
1.Encourages everyone to take vaccine ! 
2. Continuous tracking and tracing. 

Cons : 
--------------
Very hard to track and trace in a short period of time . 

Summary : Not very feasible as tracking and tracing is very time consuming.
